# [FitGirl Safer Content](https://github.com/JenieX/user-js-next/tree/main/fitgirl-safer-content)

## Description

This user script removes games that are tagged as adult games.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need the [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io) extension installed in your browser. The script has been tested on both Chrome and Edge with Violentmonkey.

Once you have Violentmonkey installed, you can simply click on the following link:

[Install this script](https://github.com/JenieX/user-js-next/raw/refs/heads/main/fitgirl-safer-content/fitgirl-safer-content.user.js)

## Usage

Once installed, the script will automatically apply the change.

## Limitations

This script will blindly remove the target contents, therefor visiting a game page that is marked as adult will give you an empty page.
